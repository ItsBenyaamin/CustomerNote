# Customer Note
One of my friends needed an application to write note on each of customer with name, phone number, date and a description of the problem, so i wrote one for him.

It's a very basic and simple application with list, create, edit, show and search features on notes.


## It uses:
* Kotlin
* Kotlin Serialization Json
* Compose
* Compose Navigation
* Room
* Paging3
* Koin
